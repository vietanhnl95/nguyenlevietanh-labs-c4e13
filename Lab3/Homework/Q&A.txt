1. Why should we use functions at all?
Functions provide better modularity and a high degree of code reusing.

2. How to define/declare a function?
def function_name():
    .....

3. How to call/use a function?
Call the function by simply call the function name or  calling it from another function.
Ex: function_name() or print(function_name())

4. What is return, why and how do we use it?
Return statement will exit a function and pass back a result.
We need return because variables born in function will also be delete when the function end.
Then we need to return the result to use outside the function.
Ex of using return:
def add(x,y):
  return (x + y)

5. Do we have to use return in every function?
No

6. What are function arguments, why and how we use it?
function arguments are variables using inside function to provide generalization.
Ex:
def subtract(x,y): #x and y are function arguments
  return(x - y)


7. How to use function from a different file other than our currently working file?
import file_name
then call function by calling file_name.function_name

or
from file_name import function_name
then call function by calling function_name
